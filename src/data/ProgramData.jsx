It has evolved over the past five decades to include many subjects, such as accounting, management, law, economics, mathematics, statistics, marketing, banking, and insurance. This is because businesses have become increasingly globalized, and there is a need for people with a strong understanding of commerce to help manage these businesses.\nIn the present scenario, there is a renewed focus on local and regional businesses. This means that there are many opportunities for B.Com graduates to work in these businesses and help them grow. B.Com graduates can also play a role in the development of the economy by helping businesses to create jobs and grow the economy.\nToday Commerce Degree is one of the most sought-after degree by those who come out of school education mainly because of three reasons: (i) the skills acquired through Commerce learning, (ii) myriad opportunities of higher education, and (iii) ever-growing job and career opportunities.  Accounting and Financial Analysis skills are the major skills acquired through a B.Com. degree, in addition to Communication, Documentation, Spreadsheets, and Data Processing Skills.  As to higher education, a commerce graduate can pursue Chartered Accountancy, Cost and Management Accountancy, Masters in Commerce, Masters in Business Administration, Masters in Company Secretaryship, Masters in Bank Management, as well as Law programs throughout the world.  Furthermore, there are many hybrid programs such as M.Sc. in Finance and Economics which admit commerce graduates.  Finally, sky is the limit when it comes to job and career opportunities for the commerce graduates.  They can become Junior Accountants, Tally Experts, Junior Accounts Officers, Payables Administration, Receivables Administration, Pay-Roll Accountants, Junior Tax Consultants, though some of these require certain additional learning in the form of certificate and diploma programmes.",

The number of registered companies in India has increased significantly since the millennium, and there are currently more than 12 lakhs registered companies. This has led to an increase in the demand for company secretaries, who are responsible officers in public and private companies. Company secretaries need to have a wide range of skills, including accounting, finance, economics, and law. They also need to be familiar with the statutory duties of a company secretary. The Degree Program in Commerce with Specialisation in Company Secretaryship is a program that prepares students for a career in company secretaryship.\nThere are many positions available for the one who is pursuing corporate secretaryship career – such as Trainee Secretary, Junior Company Secretary, Assistant Company Secretary, Deputy Company Secretary, and Company Secretary, in addition to being a “Company Secretary in practice”.  Furthermore, these graduates can also be employed in legal as well as finance departments for their hold on Accounting and Law courses in the programme.  The graduates in Corporate Secretaryship can pursue further education in Law (with specialisations in Labour and Industrial Laws, Company Law, or Taxation Law), Masters in Corporate Secretaryship, Masters in Commerce, Master of Business Administration, Master of Bank Management, and more particularly the much-coveted qualification, viz., the Associate Membership in the Institute of Company Secretaries in India (ICSI).  There are a plenty of job opportunities available even to those who complete the intermediate examination of ICSI, which is quite possible as a parallel to Corporate Secretaryship Degree learning.",

Companies collect vast amounts of data, and they use data science tools and techniques to build predictive models.\nB.Sc Data Science and Analytics is a field that can be easy to learn with proper guidance. However, it is a vast field, and it can be easy for beginners to get lost. Our B.Sc Data Science and Analytics Programme can help you learn all the concepts from the beginning.\nData scientists collect, analyze, and interpret large amounts of data. They use their knowledge of mathematics, statistics, and computer science to find patterns and trends in data. This information can be used to make better decisions, improve products, and understand customer behavior.\nData scientists are a relatively new field, but they are in high demand. This is because the amount of data that businesses collect is growing exponentially, and there is a need for people who can make sense of it.\nIf you are interested in a career in data science, there are a few things you can do to prepare. First, you should develop your skills in mathematics, statistics, and computer science. You should also learn about the different tools and techniques that data scientists use.\nThere are many online resources that can help you learn about data science. You can also find data science courses at colleges and universities.",

The methods used to study and manipulate these minute and mostly unicellular organisms differ from those used in most other biological investigations. Many microorganisms are unique among living things in their ability to use gaseous nitrogen from the air for their nutritional requirements, or to degrade complex macromolecules in such materials as wood.\nRecombinant DNA technology uses microorganisms, particularly bacteria and viruses, to amplify DNA sequences and generate the encoded products. Moving genes from one microorganism to another, or amplifying them within microorganisms, permits application of microbial skills to solve medical and environmental problems. By rearranging the genes that control these and other processes, scientists seek to engineer microorganisms that will process wastes, fertilize agricultural land, produce desirable biomolecules, and solve other problems inexpensively and safely.\nMicrobiologists pursue careers in many fields, including agricultural, environmental, food, and industrial microbiology, public health, resource management, basic research, education and pharmaceuticals.",
