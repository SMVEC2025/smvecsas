                        Higher education in the 21st century is accomplished with lot of strength,
                        opportunities and challenges. Internet supports, technological developments, growth
                        of interdisciplinary knowledge, general interest towards graduate programmes,
                        support from Regulatory Agencies and Government and continuous up gradation in
                        school curricula throw opportunities for the sustained development of higher
                        education in the current era. At the same time, grabbing the attention of the students,
                        keeping them in learning mode, engaging them with due responsibilities have
                        challenges especially due to rampant growth of technology, and quicker adaptation
                        towards it. All these things lead to the necessity of making the curriculum robust,
                        state-of-art, modern, futuristic, student-self-exploration-centric and ensuring student-
                        engagement for co-creation and teamwork. There is a greater need to synchronize the
                        skills and knowledge of the graduates of higher education and align them to the
                        industry needs and social advancements. Industries, instead of hiring generalists and
                        train them, started demanding specific skills that are needed in various domains and
                        expect the graduates to possess them on entry.
                        <br></br>
                        Having these pivotal ideas, the SMVEC School of Arts and Science was inaugurated in
                        2020. With 20 UG programmes and 5 PG programmes, the institution is widely known
                        for its academic excellence, uncompromised discipline and rocking placement records
                        in the past years. The School of Arts and Science is well proved to be the best for its
                        achievements in academics, intercollegiate awards and Placements. My sincere
                        wishes and prayers for School of Arts and Science to reach greater heights in future
                        endeavours.
